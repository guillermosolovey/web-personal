After obtaining a PhD. in Physics in Buenos Aires, I moved to New York to work on computational and 
cognitive science as a posdoc at The Rockefeller Univeristy and then at Columbia University. Back to
Argentina I joined CONICET as a researcher at the [Instituto de CÃ¡lculo](http://www.ic.fcen.uba.ar) and
since 2018 I am also a Professor at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. I have taught undergraduate and
graduate courses on human behavior, decision making, introduction to data science and a short course
on tools to journalists.

I enjoy doing experiments and using computational and statistical models to understand different 
aspects of human behavior. Lately, I have a particular interest in how we humans update beliefs when 
faced with new evidence and how we judge whether a piece of information is veridical or not. 
Together with a team of outstanding collaborators and students from various fields, we have projects 
on metacognition, social influence, fact-checking and polarization. 

I'm  deeply involved in adopting and teaching high-standard open and reproducible research methods.
I also have a particular interest in communicating data and statistical science to non-specialists
audiences and building efficient data visualizations.
