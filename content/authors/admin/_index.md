After obtaining a PhD. in Physics in Buenos Aires, I moved to New York to work on computational and 
cognitive science as a posdoc at The Rockefeller Univeristy and then at Columbia University. Back to
Argentina I joined CONICET as a researcher at the [Instituto de CÃ¡lculo](http://www.ic.fcen.uba.ar) and since 2018 I am a Professor at the Universidad de Buenos
Aires.

I enjoy doing experiments, computational and statistical models to understand different aspects of 
human behavior. Lately, I have a particular interest in how we humans update beliefs when 
faced with new evidence and how we judge whether a piece of information is veridical or not.

Together with a team of outstanding collaborators and students from various fields, we have projects 
on metacognition, social influence, fact-checking and polarization. I'm also deeply involved in adopting and teaching high-standard open science and reproducible methods.
