abstract: "This paper addresses the problem of dielectric breakdown in composite materials. The dielectric breakdown model was generalized to describe dielectric breakdown patterns in conductor-loaded composites. Conducting particles are distributed at random in the insulating matrix, and the dielectric breakdown propagates according to new rules to take into account electrical properties and particle size. Dielectric breakdown patterns are characterized by their fractal dimension D and the parameters of the Weibull distribution. Studies are carried out as a function of the fraction of conducting inhomogeneities, p. The fractal dimension D of electrical trees approaches the fractal dimension of a percolation cluster when the fraction of conducting particles approximates the percolation limit."
