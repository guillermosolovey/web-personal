A few years ago I have taught about "Science and Art" and the 
["Science of Consciousness"](https://www.utdt.edu/flyer.php/Mjk1NA)
at "Colegio Libre", a now-extint program of the Universidad Torcuato di Tella. 

Also not necessarily outreach, but I am particularly proud of [this text](https://repositorio.utdt.edu/handle/utdt/10917?locale-attribute=en) I wrote 
in 2016 for Jorge Macchi's art exposition "Refracción" at 
Universidad Torcuato di Tella. 

In 2016-2017, with Dafne Esteso, Daniel Low and Tomás Gold we created a YouTube 
channel for promoting informed debates among seemingly opposed views called 
[CONTRASTE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgqwtAqLYgUwAhiZk2m6xSQ/featured)
